### 🚀 What I’m Working On
- Designing **production-ready ML workflows** with MLflow, FastAPI, Docker & PostgreSQL  
- Building explainable AI systems using **SHAP**, with optimized computation and storage  
- Developing automation tools such as  
  - WhatsApp document-verification agent (FastAPI + Twilio)  
  - Microsoft Teams mood-meter bot with anonymous response tracking  
- Experimenting with:  
  - **YOLO** for accident detection  
  - **LLM + deep learning** for research paper recommendation
